# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Git and GitHub best practices** by following a structured workflow.  
It includes proper branching, commits, pull requests, tagging, and documentation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn how to initialize and manage a Git repository  
- Practice branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, `feature/*`)  
- Use **Pull Requests (PRs)** for code integration  
- Maintain a clean and descriptive `README.md`  
- Exclude unnecessary files with `.gitignore`  
- Track project progress using **git tags** and Markdown documentation  

---

## 🔀 Branching Workflow
- **main** → Production-ready code  
- **dev** → Development / integration branch  
- **feature/*** → New features or fixes branch  

Workflow example:
1. Create `feature/...` from `dev`  
2. Commit changes with clear messages  
3. Open PR: `feature/...` → `dev`  
4. After testing, PR: `dev` → `main`
